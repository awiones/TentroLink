# v0.6.4 Update (2025-05-15)

## Changes

- UDP DNS payloads now use a random query type for each packet: A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), TXT (Text), or NS (Nameserver).
- This increases the variety and unpredictability of DNS flood traffic, improving effectiveness and bypass potential.
- Code change: `qtype` in UDP DNS payload template is now randomly selected from `[1, 28, 16, 2]` instead of always using type 1 (A record).
- UDPFlooder now generates DNS queries with multi-level, randomized subdomains using advanced domain structure templates (e.g., multi-level, regional, service-like, and long subdomains).
- The `get_optimized_payload` method now fills these templates with random values for each DNS packet, further increasing unpredictability and bypass potential.

## Impact

- More diverse DNS queries may help evade filtering and caching mechanisms.
- Multi-level and complex subdomains make DNS flood traffic harder to filter and more effective against advanced protections.
- No breaking changes to configuration or usage.
